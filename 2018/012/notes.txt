#13: So how we doing this?

Danny, facing the camera:
    We've got a moneybags in Chile who doesn't want any future economists getting
any funny ideas about doing honest work, so we're hitting the biggest fish of them all -
the vault. "Doing Honest Work in College" isn't exactly a hot ticket item, so the vault has maybe two, three
hundred copies on a weekday, five hundred on a weekend. But on move-in day? They have
to have enough to cover all the fresh-faced dupes coming in. Fifteen. Hundred. Copies.

In voiceover, zooming in on the plans:
    The vault is guarded by the most sophisticated security system anyone's ever seen - a 14-digit
    keypad. That's why I've recruited this team, each an expert in a different number. 1. 2. 3. All
    the way...

Door opens with a hiss; everyone walks in. The room is empty. Danny walks around confused.
Camera angle changes to a low angle to show an envelope sitting
on a table. Danny walks over and picks it up.

Camera angle changes to over Danny's shoulder; letter reads:

    A BETTER THIEF BEAT YOU TO IT. BETTER LUCK NEXT YEAR.
